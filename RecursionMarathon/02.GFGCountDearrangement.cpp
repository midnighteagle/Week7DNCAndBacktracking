Count Derangements
Last Updated : 15 Apr, 2026
Given a number n, find the total number of Derangements of a set of elements from 1 to n.

A Derangement is a permutation of n elements, such that no element appears in its original position. For example, a derangement of [1, 2, 3] is [2, 3, 1].

Examples:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: For [1, 2], there is only one possible derangement [2, 1].

Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: For [1, 2, 3], there are two possible derangements [3, 1, 2] and [2, 3, 1].


[Naive Approach] Using Recursion - O(2 ^ n) Time and O(n) Space
The idea is to use recursion as, there are n-1 ways to place the first element, which explains the multiplication by (n−1). Let the first element be placed at position i, now there are two possibilities depending on whether the element at position i goes to the first position or not.

Case 1: If the element at position i is placed at the first position, then both elements are fixed, reducing the problem to n−2 elements. 
Case 2: If the element at position i is not placed at the first position, then the problem reduces to finding derangements of the remaining n−1 elements.
The formula used in the solution is:

F(n) = (n - 1) * (F(n - 1) + F(n - 2))
